//A Java interface can only contain method signatures and fields. The interface can be used to achieve polymorphism. In this problem, you will practice your knowledge on interfaces.

//You are given an interface AdvancedArithmetic which contains a method signature int divisor_sum(int n). You need to write a class called MyCalculator which implements the interface.

//divisorSum function just takes an integer as input and return the sum of all its divisors. For example divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3 and 6, so divisor_sum should return 12. The value of n will be at most 1000.

//Read the partially completed code in the editor and complete it. You just need to write the MyCalculator class only. Your class shouldn't be public.


// my own solution using java:

import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;

interface AdvancedArithmetic {
    int divisor_sum(int n);
}

class MyCalculator implements AdvancedArithmetic {
    public int divisor_sum(int n) {
        int res = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            if (n % i == 0) {
                res += i;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}

public class Solution {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        /* Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT. Your class should be named Solution. */
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int val = sc.nextInt();
        MyCalculator c = new MyCalculator();
        System.out.println("I implemented: AdvancedArithmetic ");
        System.out.println(c.divisor_sum(val));
        
        
    }
}
